# KarmaAnimalRealm
Karma is a first-person 3D survival game with Buddhist influences and atmospheric, stylistic graphics that are semi-realistic. In the future, the plan is to build an open-world with different factions and beings so that the player will be able to interact with them as well as to add an immersive quality of another world.

Developers and contributers can look that the Miro, Slack, and the Onboarding Google Doc to to get a better idea of the inspiration (the moodboard portion may be a little outdated but just minus the idea of an apocalyptic setting).

# Testing
This README is in developement. Once Internal/External builds are completed, we will update accordingly.
